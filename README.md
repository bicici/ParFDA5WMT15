The datasets and the SMT results can serve as a benchmark for SMT research where further linguistic processing can be performed. The datasets allow fast deployment of accurate SMT systems and can be used for benchmarking the performance of SMT systems.

Language models were built using SRILM (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/). Language model corpora used contain 15M sentences some of which are selected from LDC Gigaword corpora by the Parallel FDA5 algorithm:

[5 use the LDC English Gigaword 5th edition]

- Czech - English
- Finnish - English
- French - English
- German - English
- Russian - English

[1 use the LDC French Gigaword 3rd edition]

- English - French
